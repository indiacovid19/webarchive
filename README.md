India COVID-19 Reference Archive
================================

This repository contains archived snapshots of the official India
COVID-19 case numbers as they appeared in official websites. Links to
these archived snapshots may sometimes be used in the [India COVID-19
Data Archive][indiacovid19] project.

Normally, the India COVID-19 Data Archive project links to
[web.archive.org][webarchive] snapshots of the sources but sometimes the
archived snapshot for a particular date does not become available there
until a few days later and for some dates it is possible that an archive
snapshot may not appear at all. For such dates, the project may link to
one of the snapshots archived here. Later, the project may stop linking
to the snapshots here once suitable corresponding snapshots become
available at [web.archive.org][webarchive].
